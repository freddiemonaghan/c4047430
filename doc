After completing project 1 there a few things i have used before, and also not.
Such as, I have never used repisitories before, so it was nice to use to keep all my code organised in such a way that it easier to read and code inside. I loved the fact that linking github to my IDE so I can save the code by committing with messages to keep my updates organised so when I go back to code I know where i left off.
Adding a read me and license file keeps my program my own, so no one can take it. So I thought that was a good idea too.
I have never used the markdown tool before, so I am still quite unsure how it works, but it was good so I didnt have to switch in and out of a word editor.
Adding dependancies with such ease was nicer to what I am used to, where you had to download and import the libraries manually. So, using the terminal to do that was a much quicker way to add panda3d.
The committing and pushing makes it easier for programmers as then you can push your project onto github with such ease. 
With 5 years of programming experience I haven't wrote code in such an organised way that it runs a lot smoother, faster and just easier to look at within the IDE. Using terminal to download the dependancies aswell.
The last task, where we had to stop the rotation of the panda was a great oppourtunity to read through the code comments, and code itself to understand it better. Therefore, we had to use our own knowledge on the practical to see if we could achieve the solution to the problem asked. Asking us to add our if statement, allowed me to understand what the code was doing at certain points and successfully stopping the rotation proves that.
Asking us to change the variables names to something more english based, and appropriate towards the program was vital as that's how variables should look inside of real world programming problems.
